**MassLeague: A MS-based Compound Structure Annotation Framework Compatible with Federated Learning**

> A collaborative and privacy-preserving framework for compound annotation from mass spectrometry data using deep learning and federated computing.

---

## ðŸ§¬ Overview

**MassLeague** is a structural annotation framework for mass spectrometry (MS) that enables accurate, reproducible, and privacy-respecting compound identification across institutions. It integrates cutting-edge spectrum-centric and structure-centric deep learning engines with a decentralized, federated learning architecture.

MassLeague addresses challenges such as:
- Limited spectral libraries  
- Data silos across labs  
- Low reproducibility of models

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Multi Annotation Engines**
  - `FederEI v2`: EI-MS engine with in-silico spectral generation + fingerprint prediction
  - `DeepMASS v2`: MS/MS engine using Spec2Vec + structure localization

- **Federated Learning**
  - Secure multi-party computation (SMPC)
  - HNSW-based private spectral searching
  - Distributed model optimization without data sharing

---

## ðŸ§ª Use Cases

- Metabolomics: Annotation of unknown metabolites in large-scale untargeted LC/GC-MS datasets

- Toxicology: Identification of unknown compounds in complex mixtures

- Drug Discovery: Structure elucidation from MS/MS data of synthetic or natural products

- Environmental Chemistry: Compound identification in environmental samples across labs
